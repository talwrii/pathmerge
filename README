Pathmerge version 0.2

This is a tool for managing PATH, MANPATH and similar environment
variables.  Instead of messing about with colons and manipulating the
variables directly, you can say things like

export PATH=`pathmerge -d $HOME/bin $HOME/wine/inst/bin $PATH /opt/kde/bin`

to add new directories at appropriate points.  And because pathmerge
eliminates duplicates, you won't get a longer and longer list if you
source the above code more than once.

* Installing

The procedure is the same as for Perl modules.

% perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/usr/local    # or whatever
% make
